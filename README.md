## STATE
Under construction, took some steps back, so the site isn't fully functional right now.

## Description
Everyones time is valuable, and one occupation that exaggerates that more than a developer. One task that almost all projects require is a reame.md file. So while these files are relatively simple, especially in the beginning, I have created this application to save you 15+ minutes
by just entering your data for your application into the fields, and my application will generate a readme.md file for you that you can download directly into your project. Hope I have helped in your coding journey, and don't forget to bookmark my app for your other projects!

## Usage
Simply enter your project details into the corresponding fields and submit the form by clicking the button or hitting enter. It will create a README.md file for you to download to whatever destination you choose. You can also add as many new inputs as you like for your readme.md file
with the input at the bottom of the page.
