## Description
Everyones time is valuable, and one occupation that exaggerates that more than a developer. One task that almost all projects require is a reame.md file. So while these files are relatively simple, especially in the beginning, I have created this application to save you 15+ minutes
by just entering your data for your application into the fields, and my application will generate a readme.md file for you that you can download directly into your project. Hope I have helped in your coding journey, and don't forget to bookmark my app for your other projects!

## Usage
Select or create a new section and click on the text to open it into the editor, then you can change the value of each section. You can also remove sections you don't want by clicking the delete button next to the text. When you have all the sections you want and each one
customized the way you want, simply hit the download button on the page and it will generate a markdown file for you with all your created sections.
